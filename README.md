# VU CS Bsc Notes collection 

These are most of the notes I made on various computer science undergrad courses I took as a part of my bachelor. This repository is mainly just a way for me to keep track of all of these notes in an organized manner.

# Using these notes

If you happen to be a student and you want to use some of these notes I want to just add a disclaimer
- I am just a student, so I make mistakes, do not rely soley on these notes, use other sources
- If you want a wider range of different notes and solid materials for the courses checkout the [VU-CSHub](https://tinyurl.com/vucshub) my notes including other peoples notes and good materials for most of the bachelor courses are accessable there, in addition to a large variety of other resources to help you get through the courses.
